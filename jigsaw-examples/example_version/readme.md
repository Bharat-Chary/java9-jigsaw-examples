## What is this example about?
This example is not really about the Jigsaw/JPMS module system. Instead it shows that usage of the new versioning scheme.

For more background information, refer to [JEP 223](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/223).

## Sample output
This is the output of the main class for Java 9.0.4:
<pre>
Runtime.version() says, we are using Java version 9.0.4, build version 11
System properties say, we are using Java version as follows:
  java.version = 9.0.4
  java.runtime.version = 9.0.4+11
  java.vm.version = 9.0.4+11
  java.specification.version = 9
  java.vm.specification.version = 9
</pre>
